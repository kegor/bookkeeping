# Book-keeping
This is an extra simple book-keeping application.
It is based on ASP.NET MVC + ADO.NET Entity Data Model + Entity Framework and auto-generated views on Razor.

In the second iteration was added usage of the `GridMvc` package and separate filters for the `Category` and `Month`.
Also were improved few more small things: auto-incrementing ID fields, proper types for the `DateTime` inputs and e.t.c.

*TODO*: add MVVM to avoid page refresh after each filtering.
